# Provisions Shop and Price Editor
~~Also available @ [https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/2058](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/2058) but this repo will be the best spot to get the most recent updates.~~

This is a fork of a fork of a fork.

I'm updating for completeness since:

- the OG ShopList Editor is [404](https://github.com/IX-Xur/MHW-Shop-Editor)'d 

- [updated editor](https://github.com/VoldirFr/MHW-Shop-Editor) doesn't have the QoL and other features of [MHWShopListAndPriceEditor](https://github.com/aria-zivar/MHW_Shop_and_Price_Editor)

- MHWSLAPE is a tad outdated

This will be reuploaded on Nexus and this repo (ideally) should mirror the most recent version of MHW (as of writing this README, MHW is version 15.21).

**Now Requires Stracker's Loader

Provisions Shop Editor
-------------------------------------------------------
A default "shopList.slt" file has been included so you don't have to extract it manually.

In order to use created shop list files, place the "shopList.slt" file in "steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World\nativePC\common\facility"  
  
If the nativePC folder or any necessary subfolders don't exist, create them.  
  
Only the file named shopList.slt will be read by the game, so you can leave the application in "nativePC\common\facility" and create and name multiple files for your own presets, switching them as desired.

__Usage__

Open the included shopList.slt file, make your changes, then save the file into "steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World\nativePC\common\facility".

-------------------------------------------------------
Item Price Editor
-------------------------------------------------------
A default "itemData.itm" file has been included so you don't have to extract it manually.

In order to use item price files, place the modified "itemData.itm" file in the "steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World\nativePC\common\item" directory.

If the nativePC folder or any necessary subfolders don't exist, create them.

__Usage__

Open the included itemData.itm file, make your changes, save the file and copy it into "steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World\nativePC\common\item".
